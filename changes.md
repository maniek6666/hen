Each time you install HENkaku from this site, you will get the latest version. To update HENkaku, simply reboot your Vita and install again.

If you are using the offline installer and wish to update HENkaku, you must first install HENkaku again using the online installer (this website). Next, while still connected to the internet, run the offline installer bubble (not Email) and install the payload again.

If you are using Ensō, just install HENkaku again from this website and restart your Vita.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed issue where YouTube website did not work
* Added support for PSTV and Vita Slim internal storage
* Updated to [VitaShell 0.86](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases/tag/0.86)

Release 3 (August 27, 2016)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **PSN spoofing**: You can access PSN without updating to 3.61!
* Safe homebrew support: Developers can optionally mark their homebrews as "safe" and it will _not_ gain restricted API access. We highly recommend developers who are not using such features to update their packages as safe.
* [VitaShell 0.8](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell): Read the release notes from The_FloW for the list of changes to VitaShell.
* Version string: A callback to the PSP days where every hack would change the system version string. We do that too now (see the screenshot) so we can provide better support to our users.
* Update blocking: In HENkaku mode, firmware updates using the official servers are blocked. That way you won't accidentally install 3.61 and it won't download in the background regardless of your settings.

Release 2 (August 4, 2016)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Dynarec support**: Developers can generate ARM code and execute it directly. This aids in JIT engines for emulators.
* [Offline installer](https://github.com/henkaku/offline-installer/releases): HENkaku can now run without a network connection thanks to work by xyz. He also made a nice [writeup](https://blog.xyz.is/2016/henkaku-offline-installer.html) that you should check out if you're interested in the technical details.
* [VitaShell 0.7](https://bitbucket.org/TheOfficialFloW/vitashell/): When we originally released HENkaku, we forked VitaShell to molecularShell because we didn't want to spend too much time writing our own file manager. Thanks to The_FloW, our changes have been merged to the official VitaShell codebase and we no longer need molecularShell. This release had added many new features and bug fixes to the shell.

Release 1 (July 29, 2016)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* First release
